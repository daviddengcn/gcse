<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
    When I began to code in <a target="_blank" href="http://golang.org/">Go</a>,
    I loved it.  The integrated tooling for importing directly from version 
    control systems is exceptional useful.  It allows projects to be connected 
    in an elegant manner. 
</p>
<p>
    With so many brillant people contributing to the Go ecosystem, there is a 
    lot of "reinventing the wheel" happening.  Due to the way Go does imports, 
    a central clearing house like Maven or NPM is simply not needed.  However, 
    what is needed is a way to find the packages you want to import, and that is
    why GCSE was created. 
</p>
<p>
    A search engine specifically designed for Go can help in the following ways:
    <ul>
        <li>
            By analyzing the importing relations between projects, popular
            projects can be found. This gives a better ranking than general
            search engine.
        </li>
        <li>
            Structured data for each package can be extracted: package path,
            name, synopsis, documentation. Match rank can be calculated in
            a better way.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stars (or watchers) of some sites are crawled to further help ranking.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
